Objective:
A call center wants to analyze its 2023 call data in order to:
Monitor overall call volume and revenue.
Compare performance across different representatives (R01â€“R05).
Understand customer demographics and behavior patterns.
Track service quality using customer ratings.

Key Business Questions:
What is the total revenue and total number of calls handled?
How do calls vary across different months and weekdays?
Which representatives are handling the highest number of calls and generating maximum revenue?
What is the gender distribution (male vs female) of callers across different locations?
Which cities (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus) contribute the most to call volume and revenue?
How are calls distributed by rating, and what does it indicate about service quality?
Who are the top-performing representatives in terms of both call handling and revenue generation?

Goal:
By analyzing these aspects, the call center can identify top-performing agents, improve customer service quality, optimize resource allocation, and increase overall efficiency.
